# JobKu

**JobKu** is a web application built to help me track my job applications during the job search process. The main goal of this project is to provide a centralized place where I can manage and monitor the status of job applications efficiently. This project also serves as a practical way for me to deepen my knowledge of **Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Clerk authentication**.

## Features

- **Job Application Tracking:** Displays a card list with information such as the position, company, application status (pending, interview, declined), and work mode (full-time, internship).
- **Add Job:** Add a new job application with details such as position, company, status, mode (full-time/part-time/internship), and location.
- **Edit & Delete:** Update or remove job applications.
- **Filter and Pagination:** Easily filter applications based on status or other parameters (position or company), and paginate through the results for a better user experience.
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Visualize job application data through charts and graphs, displaying the number of applications for the last 6 months.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication using Clerk (email and third-party providers).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **State Management & Data Fetching:** Tanstack/React-Query + Axios
- **Form Handling & Validation:** React Hook Form, Zod
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL, Prisma
- **Charts & Date Handling:** Recharts, Day.js

This project is primarily for personal use and learning purposes. I use it to practice building full-stack applications with modern technologies and improve my understanding of state management, API integration, and data visualization.
